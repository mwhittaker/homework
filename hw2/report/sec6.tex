\section{HalfCheetah}
The learning curve for a policy trained on the \texttt{HalfCheetah-v1}
environment is given in \figref{cheetah}. The policy obtained a score of 150
around iteration 85, peaked at an average score of around 160, and ended after
100 iterations on a score of around 150. The script used to run the experiment
is given in \figref{cheetah-script}. I used a very simple neural network with 2
hidden layers with 32 units each, reward-to-go, no baseline, and a learning
rate of 0.02. Most notably, I used a very large batch size of 50,000.
